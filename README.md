# HS-Card-Guesser

Hearthstone Card Guesser is a practice project, I'm a newbie programmer so had to do something to practice. If something ain't quite right, or you feel there might be something to add, feel free to contact me.
As the name suggests is a guessing game, the player must guess the card with given clues, each clue count as a round. Points are given based on which round the right guess was made.

This first branch contains the basic layout, further improvements will be done (hopefully!).
