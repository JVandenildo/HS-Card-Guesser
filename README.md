# Hearthstone Card Guesser

Hearthstone Card Guesser is a practice project, I'm a newbie programmer so had to do something to practice. If something ain't quite right, or you feel there might be something to add/remove, feel free to contact me.  
As the name suggests, this is a guessing game, the player must guess the card with given clues. Points are given based on how many clues the player received to guess the card right.
